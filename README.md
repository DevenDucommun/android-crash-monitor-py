## üõ† Installation

### üéÜ Super Easy (For Everyone!)
**No technical knowledge required:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DevenDucommun/android-crash-monitor-py.git
cd android-crash-monitor-py
./easy-install.sh
```
Then double-click `launch-gui.py` to start the graphical interface!

**Note for macOS users:** The installer automatically installs modern Python to avoid tkinter deprecation warnings.

### Option 1: Install from PyPI (Recommended)
```bash
pip install android-crash-monitor
acm setup
```

### Option 2: Install from Source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DevenDucommun/android-crash-monitor-py.git
cd android-crash-monitor-py
pip install -e .
acm start
```

### Option 2b: Super Simple Script (No Installation)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DevenDucommun/android-crash-monitor-py.git
cd android-crash-monitor-py
./run.sh
```
The `run.sh` script handles everything automatically!

### Option 3: Portable Executable
Download the standalone executable from [Releases](../../releases) - no Python required!

## üéØ Quick Start

### Super Simple (Recommended) üöÄ

#### From Project Directory:
```bash
./start.sh
```

#### If Installed Globally:
```bash
acm start
```

That's it! One command handles everything: setup, device detection, and monitoring.

### Step by Step (Advanced Users)
1. **Run Setup**: `acm setup` - Interactive setup wizard
2. **Connect Device**: Enable USB debugging on your Android device
3. **Start Monitoring**: `acm monitor` - Begin crash monitoring
4. **View Logs**: `acm logs` - Browse collected logs with filtering
